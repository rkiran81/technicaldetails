SAGA
	Choreography	-	Order/Payment/Inventory services each have their own data base. order has to make http request to other two services
						They can also be down. to avoid multiple http requests we go with Saga with Chereography where we will not have any http calls
						Use messaging system. order will produce order created deatils to topic. payemnt will consume from that topic to produce response 
						to another topic. order will consume from this another topic and process further
	Orchestartion

CQRS
	Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. 
	Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security.
	
	Says during festival or before festival sale users will read orders and keep in cart. so read requests will be more compared to placing order
	so its better to keep read/Query service separate from Write/Update/Delete/Commands separetely
	
Transactional Outbox
	how to avoid Dual Write & Data inconsistency problem in microservice architecture using Transactional Outbox Pattern
	Gurantees reliable message delivery
	
	Order services creates order in db and wries to kafka for other services to consume. but kafka may fail or write to db may fail and so data
	can be missed in either one which is dual write.
	
	order services writes to its db and also write the order created to another outbox db with processed flag as false. 
	now a scheduler will continously poll outbox db for orders with processed flag as false and sends to kafka and updates processed flag to true
	
Sidecar
	use the sidecar design pattern in microservice architecture to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring, configuration, 
	and authentication from the primary business logic.

Event Sourcing

												Event driven pattern
												========================
												========================
1. competing consumer pattern
	one or more producers add messages to queue
	multiple consumers are set up o process these tasks
	
	how to ensure only consumer processes one tasks
	
	KAFKA
	Partitions: Kafka topics are divided into multiple partitions. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to—a structured commit log1.

	Consumer Groups: Consumers in Kafka are part of a consumer group. Each consumer in the group reads data from one or more partitions exclusively. 
					This ensures that each record is processed by only one consumer within the group1.

	Load Balancing: Kafka's partitioning mechanism allows for load balancing among consumers. When a consumer joins or leaves the group, Kafka reassigns the partitions 
					among the remaining consumers to balance the load1.

	Scalability: By adding more partitions to a topic, you can increase the number of consumers that can process messages concurrently. This makes Kafka highly scalable and capable 
					of handling high-throughput use case
		
	RABBITMQ
	Uses prefetch count
	
	AZURE SQS
	uses PEEK-LOCK mechanism
	
	AZURE SQS
	sets a visbility count

2. Retry message pattern
	
	Main Queue			-	this where new tasks are published
	Dead Letter Queue	-	holds tasks that failed multiple retries
	Retry Queue			-	this is where tasks are retried with schudeled delays. Even Main Queue can be used for this
	
	This pattern can be handled using retry count on each task

3. Async Request Response Pattern
	here correlation ID will be used.
	this will remain same across services
	
	a. an order service instance generates correlationid and publishes to queue
	b. a payment service instance consumes it, processes and publishes to queue with same correlationid
	c. now another order service instance consumes it and based on correlationid picks the additional details from db if required and process further


												Strategies to reduce latency
												========================
												========================
1. caching
	fundamental technique to reduce costly database operations
2. content delivery network
	similar to caching where cdn cahches static content (images, videos, css) that can be served to other consumers instead of hitting origin server
3. load balancing
4. db indexing
5. async processing
6. data compression
7. precaching
	is a technique used to proactively cache data in anticipation of future requests
8. use keep alive connections
	Server-Side: The server sets the Connection header to keep-alive and specifies the Keep-Alive header with parameters like timeout and max. 
				This tells the client that the server is willing to keep the connection open for a specified time and number of requests.
	Client-Side: The client sets the Connection header to keep-alive and uses an http.Agent with keepAlive set to true. 
				This allows the client to reuse the same TCP connection for multiple requests, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.
	
														Eureka
												========================
												========================
Eureka server
========================
include starter-eureka

annotate application class with @EnableEurekaServer

application.yml
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false	// to register itself with eureka server and be discoverable to other services
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false			// to fetch registry to lookup other services if required to consume
server.port=8761
spring.app.name=EUREKA-SERVER-NAME

run localhost:8071 - loads eureka dashboard

Register a service with Eureka server
======================================
include starter-eureka-discovery

annotate application class with @EnableEurekaClient

application.yml
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true	// to register with eureka server
eureka.client.fetch-registry=true		// to getch registry of other services if required
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
eureka.instance.hostname=localhost
server.port=9090
spring.app.name=SOME-SERVICE-NAME

defaultZone - It acts as a fallback URL for any client that does not express a preference for a specific Eureka server
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://eureka1:8761/eureka/
eureka.client.serviceUrl.zone1=http://eureka2:8761/eureka/
eureka.client.serviceUrl.zone2=http://eureka3:8761/eureka/


In services where the above service is to be consumed
=================================================================
include starter-eureka-discovery
annotate application class with @EnableEurekaClient
Create RestTemplate @Bean and annotate it with @LoadBalanced

Now in controller when assessing this service using RestTemplate and the url must be
http://SOME-SERVICE-NAME/path?params

then restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);//url and responseType

if this needs to be registered the add above application.yml here as well


														Spring Cloud Config Server using GitHub repository
														========================
														========================
Spring Cloud Config Server - distributed config server system. centralized place to define our configs. microservices are loosely coupled

Create spring cloud config server
add dependemcies
web, dev, starter-config-server, accuator
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
Actuator provides operational information environment properties

annotate application class with @EnableConfigServer

go to GitHub, create a reposirtory and name it example-config-server
Create a New File and name it application.properties and define the urls and other properties

in spring boot app application.properties provide github path

spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/rkiran81/example-config-server
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=${HOME}/etc // if config is in local machine
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
server.port=someport

start server and hit
http://locahost:port/actuator/default


create a service with web dependency and give this service url in app properties created in github

create a client service with dependencies web starter-config-client
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
createa rest template and call template.getForObject(url,List.class);
add @RefreshScope in controller so any update to github app properties gets reflected

in app properties add (use either)
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:port //url to cloud config server
spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888

@RefreshScope - allows beans to be refreshed at runtime without restarting the application. 
				This is particularly useful for updating configuration properties dynamically.

				

				
				
														Load Balancer using Spring Cloud Ribbon
														========================
														========================
Default/Round Ribbon/sequential disribution - sequential requests routing to different instance
List connections - define first 100 requests to instance1, next 100 to instance2 and so one
IP hash - based on IP address

create an application with dependency web and starter-ribbon

annotate application class with @RibbonClient(name='somename', configuration=RibbonConfiguration.clss) // this is our custom class

Create @Bean RestTemplate and annotate it with @LoadBalanced

Create RibbonConfiguration class and configure iping and irule

public class RibbonConfiguration{
	@autowired
	iclientconfig client;
	@bean
	puclic iping ping(iclientconfig client){
		return new PingUrl();
	}
	@bean
	puclic irule rule(iclientconfig client){
		return new availabilityfilteringrule();
	}
}

application.yml
somename:
 ribbon:
  eureka:
   enabled:false
  listOfServers:localhost:8081,localhost:8082,localhost:8083
  ServerListRefreshInterval:2000
 
ServerListRefreshInterval:2000	2 sec
ServerListRefreshInterval=30000	30 sec
Purpose:
Ensures Freshness: Keeps the server list updated by periodically fetching the latest information from the registry.
Load Balancing: Helps the load balancer distribute traffic based on the most current server status.
  
controller
String url = http://somename/path/path?xyh=asd
use this url in restTemplate

IPing:
Purpose: IPing is used to determine the availability of servers in real-time.
Function: It periodically pings the servers to check if they are up and running. If a server does not respond to the ping, it is marked as unavailable and will not receive traffic until 
			it becomes responsive again1.
Example: A common implementation is PingUrl, which sends an HTTP request to a specified URL to check the server's health1.

when loadbalacers send http request to a service to check if its running what what hhtp method and headers are used and 
what will be the response
REQUEST														RESPONSE
GET /health HTTP/1.1										HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Host: example-service.com									Content-Length: 0
User-Agent: AWS-ELB-HealthChecker/1.0
X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.2.1


IRule:
Purpose: IRule defines the load balancing strategy or rule that Ribbon uses to distribute requests among available servers.
Function: It determines which server should handle a given request based on the chosen load balancing algorithm1.
Examples:
RoundRobinRule: Distributes requests in a round-robin fashion.
WeightedResponseTimeRule: Assigns more requests to servers with faster response times.
AvailabilityFilteringRule: Filters out servers that are deemed "circuit tripped" or with high concurrent connection counts


											Load balancing using netflix ribbon + Eureka
											========================
											========================
how to perform load balancing using spring cloud eureka

	@GetMapping("/users")
	public List<Users> getUsers();
}

@FeignClient("guest-service") // defined in eureka
public interface GuestServiceClient {

    @GetMapping("/guests")
    List<Guest> getAll();

    @PostMapping("/guests")
    Guest addGuest(@RequestBody Guest guest);

    @GetMapping("/guests/{id}")

											Distributed Tracing in Microservice with Spring Cloud Sleuth & Zipkin
											========================
											========================
used in distributed tracing by generating unique traceid and spanid

service name		trace id		span id		export flag

export flag
	Now exporting is very important because very few of us run our own internal observability platform because quite 
	often it's not worth the expense or the time when you can rely on someone else who has good alerting as well as 
	visualization of that data. It also provides out-of-the-box ingress and egress behavior across all common patterns. 
	So you get trace IDs and spans on every form of ingress and every form of egress, regardless of the use case. 
	Now, Sleuth itself has a wide range of services that it supports. It supports Brave as well as the very popular Zipkin. 
	It also has some support for OTel.
	
Ingress: Manages incoming traffic to services within a cluster.
Egress: Manages outgoing traffic from services to external endpoints.
Use Cases: Ingress simplifies routing and load balancing for external requests, while egress policies ensure secure and 
compliant communication with external systems.

create an application and add starter-sleuth, starter-sleuth-zipkin dependencies
create a @configurationclass

puclic class config{

	@bean
	public alwayssampler sampler(){
		return new alwayssampler();
	}
	@bean
	public resttemplate template(){
		return new resttemplate();
	}
}

using resttemplate call the same service again and see how traceid remains same but spanid changes

now see tracing in zipkin server
create an application say zipkinserver and add web dependency, zipkin-autoconfigure-ui, zipkin-server and 
spring cloud dependency in 
dependency management
annotate application class with @enablezipkinserver
default port is 9411

logback
<configuration>
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>

												(API gateway)How to configure SpringCloud Zuul – Routing and Filtering using SpringBoot
												========================
												========================
zuul is jvm based router and server side load balancer
jvm based router - based on url pattern zuul will deceide which micriservice to route to

APIgateway app - create a springboot app with web, zuul dependencies
annotate application class with @enablezuulproxy

in app properties
server.port=8080
zuul.routes.app1-name.path=/app1-name/**     					// this is because we have multiple endpoints here
zuul.routes.app1-name.url=http://localhost:8081
zuul.routes.app2-name.url=http://localhost:8082/endpoint		// this is because we have only one endpoint here

now create 4 filter class extending ZuulFilter for prefilter, routefiler, postfilter, errorfilter and override run() and other methods and log data

now run all services and zuul gateway server
hit http://localhost:8080/app2-name/ 		// this will route to http://localhost:8082/endpoint


											Spring cloud Gateway
											===============================

Terminology to Know
Route: the basic principle of a gateway
	Defined by an ID, destination URI, predicates, and filters
	Matching is based on the aggregate of all predicates
Predicate: based on Java 8 function predicates
			a predicate is based on a Java 8 function predicate and the input is a server web exchange. 
			This allows you to match on any part of the HTTP request, including parameters, headers, the body itself. 
			Anything that fits into a server web exchange can be used as a predicate with the API gateway. 
Filter: used to modify requests and responses	
		Filters are what we use to modify the requests or the responses, either incoming or outgoing. 
		That's where we can apply server it filters that handle the security or the observability of these requests, 
		as well as truncating data going out if we find it sensitive.
											
											
											

											Microservice - Centralize configuration using spring cloud consul (HashiCorp)
											========================
											========================
download consul and where its downloaded go to that folder and run below two commands

Check IP : ipconfig
bootstrap consul : consul agent -server -bootstrap-expect=1 -data-dir=consul-data -ui -bind=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS

create a springboot app with dependencies web, consul configuration, configuration processor
add app yml
spring.cloud.consul.config.fail-fast=true
spring.cloud.consul.host=localhost
spring.cloud.consul.port=8500
application.name=consul-example


Spring Cloud Config and HashiCorp Vault are both powerful tools for managing configuration in a distributed system, but they serve slightly 
different purposes and have different strengths. Here's a comparison to help you understand the differences:

Spring Cloud Config with Git
Version Control: Spring Cloud Config typically uses Git as a backend, which means all configuration changes are versioned. This allows you to track changes over time and roll back if necessary1.
Centralized Configuration: It provides a centralized configuration server that multiple applications can query to get their configuration properties. This promotes consistency across environments1.
Ease of Use: Using Git as a backend is straightforward and integrates well with existing development workflows. Developers can manage configurations using familiar Git commands1.
Dynamic Refresh: Spring Cloud Config supports dynamic refresh of configuration properties without restarting the application, especially when combined with Spring Cloud Bus1.

HashiCorp Vault
Security: Vault is designed with security in mind. It provides robust mechanisms for managing secrets, including encryption, access control, and audit logging2.
Dynamic Secrets: Vault can generate dynamic secrets, such as database credentials, which are created on-demand and have a limited lifespan. This reduces the risk of credential leakage2.
Secret Management: Vault is excellent for managing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and certificates. It ensures that secrets are stored securely and accessed only by authorized entities2.
Integration: Vault can be integrated with various authentication methods (e.g., LDAP, AWS IAM) and can be used alongside Spring Cloud Config to enhance security for sensitive configuration properties3.

Use Cases
Spring Cloud Config with Git: Ideal for managing application configuration properties that need to be versioned and shared across multiple environments. It's great for properties that don't require high security.

HashiCorp Vault: Best suited for managing sensitive information and secrets that require strong security controls. It's also useful for generating dynamic secrets and managing access to them.
Combined Approach
In many cases, you can use both tools together. For example, you can use Spring Cloud Config with Git for general configuration properties and integrate HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information. This way, you get the best of both worlds: versioned configuration management and secure secret handling3.


													Single Sign-On with Spring Boot & Okta | OAuth 2.0
													========================
													========================

Login to okta, create account, register your app and get the client id and client secret. use that in app properties. 
@Emableoauth2sso will automatically pick it up

create springboot app with dependencies web, security, okta, cloud oauth2
annotate app class with @Emableoauth2sso

https://github.com/Java-Techie-jt/spring-boot-okta-sso

spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
Customization: 				You might need to override a bean to customize its behavior or configuration.
Third-Party Integration: 	When integrating with third-party libraries that define beans with the same names as your application's beans.

													Spring Cloud Function | @functional
													========================
													========================
https://github.com/Java-Techie-jt/spring-cloud-function-example
serverless functional programming

create springboot app and add dependencies, spring-cloud-starter-funtion-web, spring-cloud-function-compiler and spring cloud in dependency management


													SpringBoot : Spring Cloud Task
													========================
													========================
https://github.com/Java-Techie-jt/spring-cloud-task-example
spring cloud task makes it easy to create short lived microservices.it provides capabalities that let short lived jvm processes to be
executed on demand in production env

create a springboot app with dependency spring cloud task
annotate @EnableTask

implement CommandLineRunner and TaskExecutionListener

please list some practical usage of Spring Cloud Task in production - 

Data Processing Pipelines: Spring Cloud Task can be used to create short-lived microservices that process data in batches. For example, you can use it to read data from a database, 
process it, and then write the results back to another database or a data warehouse.

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Jobs: It is ideal for ETL tasks where data needs to be extracted from one source, transformed, and then loaded into another system. 
This is common in data migration projects or data integration tasks.

Scheduled Tasks: You can schedule tasks to run at specific intervals using Spring Cloud Task. This is useful for periodic maintenance tasks, such as cleaning up old data, generating reports,
 or performing system health checks.

Microservice Orchestration: Spring Cloud Task can be used to orchestrate the execution of multiple microservices. For instance, you can have a task that triggers other microservices 
to perform specific actions in a defined sequence.

Batch Job Execution: It can be used to execute batch jobs that need to run for a short duration. This is useful in scenarios where you need to process large volumes of data in chunks.

Event-Driven Processing: Spring Cloud Task can be integrated with messaging systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ to process events. For example, you can have a task that listens 
for messages on a queue and processes them as they arrive.

Resource Management: It allows for dynamic allocation of resources, ensuring that tasks only consume resources when they are running. This is beneficial in cloud environments where resource optimization is crucial.

Integration with Spring Cloud Data Flow: Spring Cloud Task can be used in conjunction with Spring Cloud Data Flow to create complex data processing workflows. This allows for better management and monitoring of tasks.


										Microservice - Spring Cloud Consul | Service Discovery
										========================
										========================
issues in eureka set up,
	we must have a eureka server
	we must manually register clients by configuring some properties in yaml file of every client
	
HashiCorp 
	1. inbuilt consul server
	2. automatically register and unregister services

download consul and start it using command
Check IP : ipconfig
bootstrap consul : consul agent -server -bootstrap-expect=1 -data-dir=consul-data -ui -bind=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS

open consul using localhost:8500 //default port

create two services with dependencies web and consul disovery

in consumer server annotate app class with org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;

in endpoint access other service as below
string url = client.genIntsances("spring.application.name").stream().map(s->s.geturi()).findFirst().map(s->s.resolve("/endpoint")).get();
restTemplate.getForObject(url, type.class)


										Microservice -Circuit breaker | Hystrix
										========================
										========================
Hystrix - fault tolerance library provided by netflix. stop delagtion of filure from one service to another. 
			hystrix internally follows circuit breaker design pattern.
circuit breaker - can be used to check availability of external services like db conn, web service call. 
					detects the failure and prevents the app from trying to perform action until it is safe to re try
					
create a service called email service with web dependency
