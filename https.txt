Symmetric key
	client generates a private key, encrypts data, sends both data and key to the server to decrypt
	here an hacker/MMA (Man in the Middle Attack) can steal the client private key as well as data

Asymmetric key
	server generates two keys,
	Public key	- is used for encryption
	Private key	- is used for decryption
	
	server shares its Asymmetric Public key to the client.
	client encrypts its data using its own symmetric private key and sends that encrypted data to server
	also client encrypts its symmetric private key using above Asymmetric public key and sends it to server
	now server decrypts this encrypted symmetric private key using server's Asymmetric private key and uses this symmetric private key to decrypt data
	
	
In above scenario, a hacker can intercept the Asymmetric Public key from server and share his own public key to client acting as proxy.
now the client is unware of this. This is where SSL certificates come into picture


SSL Issuer/Let's Encrypt
1. server shares its public key and sever url to issuer and asks for certificates
2. issuer also has a private and public key.
3. issuer creates a certificate using the server url and creates certificate and using a signature equal to server pub key + issuer pub key
4. now during client server interaction server shares its asymmetric public and certificate to client.
5. client contacts issuer and receives its public key and client verfies that public key is same as in certificate.
6. if same then its assured that server aymmetric public key is not changed by any hacker.
