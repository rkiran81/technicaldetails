INDEX
CREATE INDEX <index name> ON tablename(columnname);

When to Index
Primary Keys: Always index primary key columns, as they uniquely identify each row.
Foreign Keys: Index foreign key columns to improve JOIN operations.
Frequently Queried Columns: Index columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.
Selective Columns: Index columns with high selectivity, meaning they have a large number of unique values.

When Not to Index
Low Selectivity Columns: Avoid indexing columns with low selectivity, such as boolean columns or columns with a small range of values.
Rarely Queried Columns: Avoid indexing columns that are rarely used in queries.
Columns with Frequent Updates: Avoid indexing columns that are frequently updated, as this can lead to significant overhead.
